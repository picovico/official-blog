They say 'thank you' is an incredibly powerful pair of words because being appreciated keeps us motivated both at work and in life and also, it strengthens our relationship with our dearest ones. Gratitude also helps us experience the goodness in life, keeping us healthy both mentally and physically throughout. And, expressing gratitude is the heart of Thanksgiving. It gives us an opportunity to spend an entire day with our family and friends, savor a fine meal and be thankful for many things, either great or simple, in life.
