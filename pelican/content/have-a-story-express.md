Summary: 

Expression is the soul &amp; language of mankind and the essence of human heart. Life is devoid of charm, sweetness and that tenderness of love without expressing our feelings. And hence we, at Picovico, intend to make this world diabetic with the sweetness of expression spreading like an epidemic.

We vouch that there will be no lines of territories and region beholding it. YES, the world should fall in for Picovico and never feel goose bumps or trembling feet while expressing. Be it the gesture of care for your parents, those promises of togetherness for friends or the affection to your love, all lead to us. We believe that relations would become more bonded, because Picovico Team has that inherent passion to make it happen. Not very long from now, we aim to become synonymous to this word – ‘express’.
