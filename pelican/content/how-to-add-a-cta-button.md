Summary: Picovico for premium accounts now offers you its handy CTA feature to add into your Picovico video contents for an effective online marketing. This way you can make..

Why does your business need marketing? The most straightforward answer to this question would be to expose people to your product and your brand. However, in today’s world of interactive marketing, the answer does not limit to that because you can not only create effective ad contents to promote your product but also, convert the consumers from viewers to buyers on the spot. But how can you actually do that? This is where call to action comes in.

A call-to-action (CTA) is a button that gives instruction to the prospective audience to take an immediate action after viewing any of your online contents. The instruction usually takes the form of imperative verb, such as “start your free trial”, "buy now", “download”, etc. The point of having a CTA button is to let your audience take the next step and not miss out on your amazing offerings.  

Picovico for premium accounts now offers its handy CTA feature to add into your Picovico video contents for an effective online marketing. This way you can make it easy for your audience to follow-through your video ads, engage them into your brand and nurture them into becoming your customers then and there.
