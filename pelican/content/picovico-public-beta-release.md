Summary: 

<div style="text-align: justify;">"If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video must be worth millions of words". This has been our motto at Picovico ever since it was conceived. Finally after almost a year of restless development we are pleased to announce the public beta release of <a href="http://www.picovico.com/" target="_blank">www.picovico.com</a>.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">Picovico is a cloud based video creation platform. It takes a set of images, blends it with the music and produces a beautiful video plotted alongside your story. The core intelligent system has formed the brain of Picovico and thus keeps you away from the hectic task of defining the effects and animations.</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Video making with Picovico is easy and seamless:
- Upload your images or import from facebook/flickr
- Optionally, add captions to your images
- Select music from our library or upload your own
- And rest back, while we do the rest for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the video is ready, you can share it with your friends or even export it to other online-video-sharing-<wbr>platforms.</wbr></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Videos created with Picovico are more than just videos, they are memories. Give it a spin!</p>
