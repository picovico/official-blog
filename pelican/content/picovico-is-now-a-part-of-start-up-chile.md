<a href="http://startupchile.org/" target="_blank">Start-up Chile</a> is a program created by the Govt. of Chile that seeks to attract high-potential entrepreneurs to bootstrap their startups in Chile, using it as a platform to go global.

Hailing from 37 nations,<a href="http://startupchile.org/congrats-ya´ll/" target="_blank">101 teams</a> were selected from a very competitive pool of 1509 applications.

Last year, Picovico was selected by “<a href="http://themorpheus.com/" target="_blank">Morpheus Venture Partners</a>”, a startup accelerator based in india, which mentored Picovico team for development of the product. During the period, many new features and dynamics were added to the product. We thank Sameer and Nandini, Co-Founders/Mentors-duo from Morpheus, for being such an amazing mentors.

This selection is cheered by the Picovico Team and we all are excited about it. The news has added excitement and zeal in the team to take it to greater heights. We expect to expand the team and get international exposure, and promise to build exciting features into the product.

We will be moving soon to Santiago for the program. We will keep you updated. Till then <em>hasta la vista. </em>
