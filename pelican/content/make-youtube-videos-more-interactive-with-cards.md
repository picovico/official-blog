Summary: Use the new Cards feature in YouTube to provide additional information while a viewer is watching your Picovico video.

Recently Youtube introduced a new feature called 'Cards' for video publishers. If you have been publishing on this platform, you’ve probably used annotations to engage with your viewers. There were some limitation with it especially the kind of info you could share using it. And most importantly it is incompatibilty over mobile devices.
 
The new Cards are an improved form of those annotations and will eventually replace them. As Youtube puts it, "They can inform your viewers about other videos, merch, playlists, websites and more. They look as beautiful as your videos, are available anytime during the video and yes, they finally work on mobile."
There are six types of cards to choose from: Merchandise, Fundraising, Video, Playlist, Associated Website and Fan Funding. The list will increase with time and you’ll find a new “Cards” tab in your Video Editor to create and edit them at any time.

The interdevice compatibility of cards gives publisher more flexibility to share what they want.  We're liking the feature from our initial trial uses. You should try it out too. If you have any innovative idea in which this feature can be used, share with us in the comments below.
