Summary: 

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the release of Picovico two weeks back, we have seen tremendous response from users. We have seen a lot of interest, received a lot of queries, and a lot of encouragement. Innovation is a process. Million thanks to all our users who are constantly helping us upgrade our product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://blog.picovico.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/picovico-export-yoututbe-facebook.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Export to Youtube/Facebook" src="http://blog.picovico.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/picovico-export-yoututbe-facebook.png" alt="Export to Youtube/Facebook" width="158" height="465" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past two weeks, we received a lot of e-mails asking us if the Picovico videos could be exported to Youtube and Facebook. In order to make the Picovico experience a lot more fun, we have added this new feature — Picovico now allows you to export your videos directly to Facebook and Youtube! \m/</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This can be done by following few simple steps. On the video page, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">click on <em>‘Video Settings’</em> &gt; <em>‘Export to Youtube’</em> or <em>‘Export to Facebook’</em></span> to release your video to youtube and facebook respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This new feature will allow you to share your beautiful memories with your family members, friends, and people in your network. Did someone not say, ‘Happiness multiplies when shared.’ So, be ready to share your joy with others!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not very enthusiastic about exporting your video to Facebook/Youtube, it is perfectly alright. You can still share the direct video link with your loved ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And yes, you can expect a lot more features from Picovico lab. Our team is working hard to give that perfect tool to you!</p>
