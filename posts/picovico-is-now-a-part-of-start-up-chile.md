Partners](http://themorpheus.com/)”, a startup accelerator based in india,
which mentored Picovico team for development of the product. During the

Sameer and Nandini, Co-Founders/Mentors-duo from Morpheus, for being such an
amazing mentors. This selection is cheered by the Picovico Team and we all are
excited about it. The news has added excitement and zeal in the team to take
it to greater heights. We expect to expand the team and get international
exposure, and promise to build exciting features into the product. We will be
moving soon to Santiago for the program. We will keep you updated. Till then
