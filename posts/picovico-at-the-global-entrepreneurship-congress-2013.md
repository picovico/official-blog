Suraj Sapkota from Chile will be representing Picovico Inc, a San Francisco based company originated in Nepal, at the congress. [Picovico](http://www.picovico.com), where pico stands for photos or pictures and vico stands for videos, is a tool for converting photos into a slideshow with music and texts co-created by Manish Modi and Suraj Sapkota.  Every photo clicked has a story behind it, with an aim to facilitate the act of photo sharing keeping the story associated with each snap intact and to make the art of storytelling more appealing, the two engineers from Nepal Manish Modi and Suraj Sapkota came up with this idea of creating a free web based tool. The duo was supported in their endeavor by Morpheus, a startup accelerator, and later the startup was included in [Start-up Chile program](http://www.picovico.com/blog/picovico-is-now-a-part-of-start-up-chile.html). The tool is [easy to use](http://www.picovico.com/blog/how-to-make-a-video.html) and allows you choose from wide range of styles. You can add photos from your computer or import from Facebook or Flickr, add text to each photo, add music of your choice or from the available list of music and title and short description to the video. Thus created video can be downloaded, burnt on a DVD, and even used in [powerpoint presentation](http://www.picovico.com/blog/picovico-video-presentation-tools.html). So, if you have snaps with an interesting story behind them, go Picovico! -written on : 2013-03-20 09:20:09
