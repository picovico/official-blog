national daily “The Hindu”. ****Here is an excerpt: ** ****Most photo-sharing
sites are about simple uploads of photos. But PicoVico (www.picovico.com)
promises a difference. Here you can use your photos to create video
slideshows. It is created by young entrepreneurs Manish Modi and Suraj
Sapkota. Picovico.com came about when they realized that waiting for photos to
load in conventional photo-sharing sites was boring and a waste of time. “We
thought creating seamless videos from photos will help users convey the story
behind the memories and save time as well,” says Modi. In
[Picovico](http://www.picovico.com), Pico stands for photos and Vico for
videos. Modi and Sapkota did their computer engineering together and are
programmers who love to code. Suraj is an avid photographer too. “The site has
four basic steps to create a video,” says Modi. “Users can select the style of
presentation from the many templates we have, add photos and text, select
music of their choice and then put in the titles and credits. Once these four
steps are completed the video is created in a minute. You can export the video
to Facebook or Youtube.” Read the entire article here -
