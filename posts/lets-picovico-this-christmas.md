new video styles designed around Christmas theme. After days of designing,
Picovico team brings you Christmas dedicated video styles so that you can
share your pictures in an even attractive way this season.

The two themes are: Christmas Outdoor and Christmas Indoor and here is a
glimpse of how they look. [![Picovico Outdoor Christmas Video

You simply add your photos, choose one of these styles and create your video.
Video quality ranges from 360p to HD and you can download the videos on your
device to share anywhere.

And interestingly, when you [download the app](http://goo.gl/VJbzuX) and use
one of these themes in a video within Dec 27, we can feature you on our
facebook page and twitter profile. But do not forget to mention @picovico when
you share the video on Facebook, Twitter or Youtube. So download the app today
and gift someone a Picovico video this holiday.

If you want to watch some sample videos before you start creating your own,
