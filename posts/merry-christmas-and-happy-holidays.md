The yuletide season has begun and the air is filled with Christmas and
celebrations. It’s the season of holidays, parties, hangouts, exchanging
gifts. And before you get dissolved in this celebratory air, we at Picovico
wanna thank you for being with us in the journey, with all the highs and lows.
Wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!!

them.”

And, don’t forget to share your magic moments with your friends. -written on :
