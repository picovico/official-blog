There is nothing like joy of sharing photographs online. Last night’s dinner,
cousins birthday bash, parents dance-in together, or the band’s concert- don’t
we share everything. And why not? One can tag  friends and the moments, get
comments from everywhere, envy few friends and make statement on the web-
social world.

We intend to take this marvel experience to next level by introducing our
latest **Facebook Application** called **PicoVico**. **PicoVico** will help
you convert your online photo albums into cool video with the music and effect
of your choice. Your college farewell party or your office pizza break: they
all can become your own video _(How about that?)_ You can tag friends, choose
the sound tracks, visual effects among others.

So, log into Facebook, and share your experience with Pico Vico touch. Not
only it will help you to enhance your creativity in your own photographs but
also help you make compilation of favorite movies, sports stars, cars or
clubs.(H_ow about your own photo shoot video._)

“They say a picture is worth thousand words. We assure you that your video
would be worth million words ”

[_ Introducing the new kid in the town of facebook. The kid is looking for
friends!! The friends who have picture!! The pictures which means them a lot!!
A lot, yes lot so that they can make video from  them! The video in your
facebook!! just few clicks away!! Away: Not exactly]_
