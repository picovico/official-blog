The Official Blog for Picovico [blog.picovico.com](http://blog.picovico.com)

After we chose to move our blog to github, the first question was how to manage the static pages. 

- Jekyll and github ? - rails thing didn't often work for [@acpmasquerade](//github.com/acpmasquerade). (even though he tries every month once :P )
- Hyde (the evil brother of Jekyll) - may be next time
- Mkdocs - (he is too fond of ) - did half of work with mkdocs already.
- pelican - (when one of our mates suggested to try pelican), ([@acpmasquerade](//github.com/acpmasquerade) had been looking easier templating, and few other assisting commands. Including some proper deploy assistant)

Hence we chose [pelican](//github.com/getpelican). (Thanks to [@ludbek](//github.com/ludbek) for his suggestion.)
[@acpmasquerade](//github.com/acpmasquerade) says he is too happy with his decision to move the blog, and (em)power it with [@getpelican](//github.com/getpelican) and @github.
