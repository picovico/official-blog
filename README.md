The Official Blog for Picovico (blog.picovico.com)

After we chose to move our blog to github, the first question was how to manage the static pages. 

- Jekyll and github ? - rails thing didn't often work for @acpmasquerade. (even though he tries every month once :P )
- Hyde (the evil brother of Jekyll) - may be next time
- Mkdocs - (he is too fond of ) - did half of work with mkdocs already.
- pelican - (when one of our mates suggested to try pelican), (@acpmasquerade had been looking easier templating, and few other assisting commands. Including some proper deploy assistant)

Hence we chose @pelican. (Thanks to @ludbek for his suggestion.)
@acpmasquerade says he is too happy with his decision to move the blog, and (em)power it with @pelican and @github.
