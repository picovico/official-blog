Summary: 


Rotaract Nepal and Picovico have together launched a video making contest for both members and non-members. Rotaract's recent meeting held in Kathmandu saw members and presidents from different Rotaract Chapters throughout Nepal be a part of a day-long session. This session discussed on taking clubs forward, training to improve club activities and planning the upcoming year at the clubs. And as a part of the drive to engage people more with the club, the video contest was launched.

In this contest, participants will be required to make slideshow video using Picovico Slideshow Maker app on their Android device and submit it in their chosen category. The three categories are: #MyYearsinRotartact, #ColorsofNepal and #MyMemories. The best video stories will be short listed among which the final winners will be selected. The winning videos will get the privilege of being shown to all Rotaract members and also take away attractive prize. Details of the contest will soon be posted on this blog.

The aim of this contest is to bring out some interesting stories that people have to share with others. It will act as a platform to communicate their message to a big mass of people and since Picovico videos are easy to make, anyone with basic knowledge of using a smartphone can participate. So if this sounds interesting to you, stay connected with this on our social channels as we release all the details.
