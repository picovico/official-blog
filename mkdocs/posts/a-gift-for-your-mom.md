<p id="internal-source-marker_0.012883906498543762" dir="ltr">Every Child is special...but, ‘so is every mother’. Regardless of the amount of money you accumulate, the height of success you attain, or the fame that your name earns, you will always remain your mom’s child, and you will remain indebted to her for all the love she gave you, for all the blessings she showered upon you, for all the sacrifices she made for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" dir="ltr"><a href="http://bit.ly/pv-happy-mother-day" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-126" title="Mother's Day Image" src="http://blog.picovico.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/mothers_day.png" alt="Mother's Day Image" width="640" height="360" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A mother plays myriad of roles in our lives, which can’t really be put down in a sheet of paper. She is a gentle touch, a soft lullaby, a pillar of strength, an epitome of love, a friend, a confidante, and everything beautiful that comes with life. It is rightly said, “God could not be everywhere, so he (it) created mothers.” How very true this is.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At some point of time in life, every child feels the need to thank his/her mother for everything she does. You probably recall all the blissful moments that you have shared with your mother, and you know deep down how grateful you are to her for being there for you, every day. But, it is very much likely that you have not been able to express those emotions, those feelings, those sentiments to your mother. This is very natural, but we are here to help you show your gratitude to your mother.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This Mother’s Day, do something special for her, and let her know what she means to you. Thank her with a personalized video that she can treasure for life. Collect some pictures of you and her and that lovely childhood being bestowed with love from her, blend it with some lovely music and create a lifetime memory in the form of a video for the special woman in your life.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And this is not the end of it. We understand what mothers mean to all of us. So, to make the day even more special, we have a deal for you.
