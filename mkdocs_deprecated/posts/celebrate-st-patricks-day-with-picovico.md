Dance, music, Irish food and drinks; whatever you do on this day must be fun. Green-gold is the theme, so go green otherwise you will be pinched ;)

Memories of getting drunk, trying Irish food, dancing to a local Irish song, and making friends during celebration lasts for a lifetime. Obviously, you gotta capture those moments and converting them into a video would be a good idea. Don’t you think so? Well, we think its perfect.

Rather than going through the album, you can just play a video to relive those times. And to convert those pictures into a fine video; what better tool can you find than<strong><a title="Picovico" href="http://www.picovico.com" target="_blank"> Picovico</a></strong>. <a title="Slideshow maker " href="http://www.picovico.com/blog/how-to-make-a-video.html" target="_blank">Making video</a> with Picovico is a fun process.
